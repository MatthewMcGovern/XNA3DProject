ADDED:
- Change log
- Debug log ingame
-- Static so it can be called from anywhere
-- Has multiple message types
- Ramp blocks top/bottom
-- combines/obscures vertices like cubes
- Started the editor

FIXES:
- Fixed bottom ramps textures pointing the wrong way.

TODO:
- Finish the editor, but first:
- Add a "World" wrapper so I can access the frigging effect files rather than making a copy all over the place -_-
- Drawable complex components need a "draw model" mode and a "draw cubeworld" mode as they vary.

ADDED:
- SegmentManager
-- Segments
--- Render Segments
--- Item cotainers!
---- Items

- Block Masks

NOTES:
Cubes only draw visible vertices.
Render chunks are only updated when a face changes, this way cubes can be recalculated without hindering performance!
